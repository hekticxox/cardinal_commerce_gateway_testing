Step 2: Use Burp Extensions to Decrypt and Analyze JWTs

There are Burp extensions that can help you inspect and manipulate JWT tokens with ease. Two notable ones are JWT Editor and JSON Web Token.
Installing the JWT Editor Extension:

    Open Burp Suite.
    Go to the Extender tab and select BApp Store.
    Search for the JWT Editor extension and click Install.
    Once installed, go to the Extender tab â†’ JWT Editor. This will show you an interface to manipulate JWT tokens.
    
    How to Use the JWT Editor:

    Capture a JWT from one of your intercepted requests, like the /Collect or /Cruise/StepUp request that contains the Authorization: Bearer <JWT> header.
    Right-click on the JWT in the request, then select JWT Editor.
    The JWT Editor will allow you to:
        Decode the JWT (header, payload, and signature).
        Inspect the payload to analyze its claims, such as sub, exp, or custom fields.
        Edit the payload if needed for testing purposes (e.g., changing user roles, expiration time).
    The JWT is usually split into three parts:
        Header: Contains the algorithm used (e.g., HS256).
        Payload: Contains the claims (e.g., user info, roles, etc.).
        Signature: Verifies the token's integrity.
