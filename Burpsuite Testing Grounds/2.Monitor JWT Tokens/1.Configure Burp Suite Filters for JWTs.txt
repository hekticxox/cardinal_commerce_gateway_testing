Step 1: Configure Burp Suite Filters for JWTs

You’ll need to make sure you're only focusing on the traffic that contains JWT tokens. This can be done by setting up some filters in Burp Suite.
Set Up Filters to Capture JWTs

    Open Burp Suite and go to the Proxy tab.
    Go to the Intercept sub-tab.
    Under Intercept is on, you’ll see the requests being captured. Right-click on a request that includes a JWT (usually in headers like Authorization: Bearer <JWT>), and select Send to Intruder or Send to Repeater.
    Now go to the Target tab and right-click on the specific host or path you want to monitor, such as /Collect, /Cruise/StepUp, or /Authenticate. You’ll set filters for those endpoints.
