Step 3: Set Up Match-and-Replace Rules

If you want to automatically replace or modify JWT tokens, Burp Suite's Match and Replace feature can help:

    Go to Proxy → Options.
    Under Match and Replace, click Add.
    You’ll be prompted to specify:
        Match: Define what part of the JWT you want to match. For example, you can match the Authorization header containing Bearer <JWT>.
        Replace: Define what you want to replace it with. This can be another JWT or any specific string.
    After setting up your match-and-replace rule, Burp will automatically replace the JWT with the one you've defined, allowing you to manipulate requests for testing.
