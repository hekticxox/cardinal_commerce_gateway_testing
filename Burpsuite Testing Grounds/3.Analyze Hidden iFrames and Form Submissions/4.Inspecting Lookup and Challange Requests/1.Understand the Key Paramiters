Step 1: Understand the Key Parameters

In the Lookup and Challenge requests, several parameters are critical to understanding and manipulating the requests properly.

    DFReferenceId:
        This is a unique reference identifier for the transaction generated by the 3DS process.
        It helps track the transaction across multiple steps in the authentication process.

    TransactionId:
        Similar to DFReferenceId, this is the ID used to identify the transaction.
        It will typically be used in the Challenge request to verify the transaction details.

    ACSUrl (Access Control Server URL):
        The ACSUrl is used to redirect the user to the 3DS access control server for additional authentication steps.
        This will typically contain the URL where the challenge will occur, like a bank’s verification page.

    Payload:
        This contains the actual data to be sent to the ACS server or the merchant’s system. It’s often encoded or encrypted.
        In 3DS, it may contain a mix of transaction information and user data that must be verified.
