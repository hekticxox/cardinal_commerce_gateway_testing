Step 3: Analyzing Lookup and Challenge Requests in Burp Suite

After capturing the requests, let's break down the steps to analyze them in Burp:
1. Focus on Key Parameters:

    DFReferenceId and TransactionId:

        When analyzing the request in Burp Suite, look at the Request tab in the HTTP History section.

        Search for parameters like DFReferenceId and TransactionId in the query string or request body (for POST requests).

        For example:

    POST /3ds/lookup HTTP/1.1
    Host: example.com
    Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
    Content-Length: 123

    DFReferenceId=abc123&TransactionId=xyz987&Payload=someencrypteddata

ACSUrl:

    The ACSUrl parameter is a URL that will typically appear in the response from the server or in the request for the Challenge step.

    If you see a request containing an ACSUrl, it means that the user is being redirected for further authentication.

    Example:

        HTTP/1.1 302 Found
        Location: https://bank-acs.com/authenticate?transactionId=xyz987

2. Inspect the Payload:

    The Payload often contains transaction and user data, but it may be encoded (e.g., base64) or encrypted (e.g., using AES or RSA).

    Check for any signs of encoding or encryption. If the payload is encoded (e.g., base64), you can decode it directly within Burp Suite or using an external tool like CyberChef.

    Example:

    Payload=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ0c3QiOiJKU1M2R0EySklkOjo2OGs1Zm9lKX6Q==

    If the payload is encrypted, you may need to decrypt it by identifying the encryption method (AES, RSA) or using keys if available.

3. Verify Browser Field Values:

    For both Lookup and Challenge requests, the browser sends fields that can be used to verify the authenticity of the request.
    These fields include parameters like BrowserJavaEnabled, BrowserHeader, and others that confirm details about the user's browser.

Common Browser Fields:

    BrowserJavaEnabled: This flag indicates whether Java is enabled in the browser.

    BrowserHeader: Includes details about the userâ€™s browser and operating system.

    Example of such fields in a request:

BrowserJavaEnabled=true
BrowserHeader=Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/89.0.4389.82 Safari/537.36
