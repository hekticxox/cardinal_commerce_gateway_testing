Step 2: Capture the Lookup and Challenge Requests in Burp Suite

    Ensure Burp Suite is Set Up to Capture Traffic:
        Make sure youâ€™ve got your proxy setup in Burp Suite and that your browser is routing traffic through it.
        In the Proxy tab, ensure Intercept is turned on to capture the requests as they pass through.

    Perform Actions That Trigger Lookup and Challenge Requests:
        Go through the payment process or any other flow where you expect to see Lookup and Challenge requests.
        Look for POST or GET requests that include the DFReferenceId, TransactionId, ACSUrl, and Payload.
