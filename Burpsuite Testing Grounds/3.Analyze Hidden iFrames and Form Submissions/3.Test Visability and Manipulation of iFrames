3. Test Visibility and Manipulation of iFrames

In this step, we'll cover testing the visibility and interaction with iFrames and forms.
Step 1: Manipulate Hidden iFrames

    Force Interaction: You can manipulate hidden iFrames by exposing them with browser tools or CSS changes.
        For example, using browser DevTools, you can remove the CSS rule hiding the iFrame, making it visible and interacting with it directly.

    Example command in browser DevTools console to show the hidden iFrame:

    document.querySelector('iframe').style.display = 'block';

Step 2: Modifying Form Data or Token Values

    If you identify that a form is submitting sensitive data or JWT tokens, you can try manipulating the form values using the Intercept tab in Burp Suite:
        Change hidden form fields like auth_token or JWT values.
        Modify the iFrame content by altering request payloads or injecting custom data before sending the form submission.

Step 3: Use Burp Extensions for JWT/Token Decryption

If the form or iFrame involves JWT tokens or other encrypted payloads, you can use Burp Suite Extensions like the JWT Editor to decode and manipulate JWT tokens before theyâ€™re sent.
