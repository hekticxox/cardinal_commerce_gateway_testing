Step 4: Reproduce and Manipulate Traffic
A. Use Repeater for Replay

    Right-click a captured request and send it to Repeater.
    Modify fields like JWT, TransactionId, or encrypted payloads.
    Replay the request and observe responses to understand how Cardinal processes data.

B. Test for Vulnerabilities

    Tamper with parameters:
        Invalid/missing JWT.
        Corrupt transaction data.
        Delay or modify headers like Origin, User-Agent, etc.
    Observe error messages or unexpected responses.
