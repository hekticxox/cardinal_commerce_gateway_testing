Step 2: Configure Burp Suite to Focus on These Endpoints
A. Setting the Target Scope

    Open Burp Suite and go to the "Target" tab.
    In the left pane under "Scope", click "Add to Scope".
    Define your scope:
        Include traffic for:

        *cardinalcommerce.com/Encrypted/GetInfo
        *cardinalcommerce.com/Collect
        *cardinalcommerce.com/Cruise/StepUp
        *cardinalcommerce.com/Cruise/Authenticate

        Use regex if needed: .*cardinalcommerce\.com\/(Encrypted\/GetInfo|Collect|Cruise\/StepUp|Cruise\/Authenticate).*.

B. Filter Traffic in Proxy

    Go to the Proxy tab and ensure intercept is enabled.
    Under HTTP history, use the filter options:
        Include only traffic matching the above endpoints.
        Use "Show only in-scope items" to declutter your view.
