Step 3: Verify and Intercept Requests
A. Run the Application

    Launch the app or browser session that interacts with the Cardinal 3DS flow.
    Use Burp's CA Certificate to intercept SSL/TLS traffic:
        Go to Options â†’ SSL/TLS, install the Burp certificate, and configure your browser/device to trust it.
        Ensure HTTPS traffic is captured.

B. Monitor Requests

    You should see requests to the target endpoints appearing in Burp's Proxy tab.

C. Inspect Request/Response Details

    Click on each request to view:
        Headers: Look for Authorization (JWT tokens), Content-Type, and any unique API keys.
        Payloads: Check POST/PUT payloads for sensitive data (JSON, Base64, etc.).
        Responses: Analyze returned data, especially for TransactionId and encrypted fields.
