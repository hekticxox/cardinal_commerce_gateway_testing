Using BurpSuite:

BurpSuite shines in testing web apps, so here’s the plan:
1. Intercept Requests:

    Fire up BurpSuite’s Proxy and capture the requests when the app is generating or validating JWTs.
    Look for the Authorization header (usually Bearer <JWT>).

2. Decode the JWT:

    Copy the JWT from the intercepted traffic.
    Head over to a tool like jwt.io or use Burp extensions (like JSON Web Tokens) to decode it.

3. Analyze Claims:

    Look at the payload and claims in the token. Sometimes devs leave hints (like kid, alg, or other custom claims).

4. Test Weak Algorithms:

    If the algorithm is none, you’re in luck. Change the header to "alg": "none" and sign it with an empty signature.
    Some systems fall for this trick.

5. Brute Forcing the Key:

    If the algorithm is something like HS256, you can try brute-forcing the secret key using tools like:
        JWT Cracker (Python script)
        BurpSuite extension (JWT_Fuzz or JWT Editor)

6. Session Hijacking:

    If you can modify the payload and sign with a guessed key, hijack a session or escalate privileges.

Using Wireshark:

Wireshark’s about sniffin’ raw traffic. Here’s how to work it:
1. Capture Encrypted Traffic:

    If the app is using HTTPS, you need the server’s private key to decrypt the traffic. This is unlikely unless you have access.

2. Look for Unencrypted JWTs:

    Analyze packets for Authorization headers or other endpoints passing JWTs.
    Use Wireshark’s Follow TCP Stream feature to isolate traffic.

3. Inspect the JWT Exchange:

    Look for handshake details during JWT generation. Sometimes, secret keys are leaked in error responses or debug info.

Other Tactics:

    Weak Key Guessing:
        Developers often use weak keys like secret, password, or environment variables. Test common ones.

    Source Code Analysis:
        If you got access to source files via something like git clone from misconfigured repos, search for the secret in environment files or configs.

    Error Responses:
        Misconfigurations might spill error details, including hints about the signing process.

    Timing Attacks:
        In rare cases, poorly implemented JWT validations can reveal the secret key through response times.

Warnings:

    Ethics Check: If this ain’t your system, tread carefully. Unauthorized access is illegal, boss.
    Logging Awareness: BurpSuite or Wireshark might leave traces in logs; cover your tracks.

Keep it sharp and safe, Chapta.
