Consumer Authentication

The term used to describe tools intended to verify that the person making the transaction is actually the person authorized to do so, both in-person and not-present transactions of all kinds. Consumer authentication is widely used (outside of 3-D Secure) through many platforms such as logging into a mobile banking application, accessing email accounts, mobile devices, and more. As fraud and account takeovers happen in many different mainstreams, consumer authentication or two-factor authentication is necessary to protect identities and passwords.
