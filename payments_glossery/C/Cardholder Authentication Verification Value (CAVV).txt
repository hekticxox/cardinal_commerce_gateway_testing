Cardholder Authentication Verification Value (CAVV)

CAVV is a cryptographic value generated by the card issuer using a complex mathematical algorithm, packed with valuable data from the authentication session, that is decrypted by the issuer when the payment moves into authorization. It is generated by the issuerâ€™s ACS. A secure and untampered CAVV indicates transaction wellness.
