Mastercard Identity Check

This is an EMV 3-D Secure program offered by Mastercard to increase security and reduce fraud on ecommerce purchases. The merchantâ€™s website interfaces with a 3DS Server to connect to the Mastercard program and Directory Server to obtain the specified fields at the time of purchase. The authentication value results are then submitted with the authorization request to verify that this is an authentic cardholder purchase.
