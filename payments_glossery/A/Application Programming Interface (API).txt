Application Programming Interface (API)

A package of software, tools, documentation, and definitions designed to allow software developers to seamlessly access a software service or application. APIs allow a user to complete an action without leaving your website.

Many of Cardinalâ€™s integration methods for merchants and issuers connect to our products and services using a single or hybrid API-based solution!
