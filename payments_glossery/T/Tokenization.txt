Tokenization

Tokenization keeps a customer’s card data safe when processing a payment. It is data security technology that substitutes non-sensitive random numerical sequences for sensitive credit card data in the transaction process so it can be passed over the internet without exposing the data to fraudsters. Tokenization decreases a merchant’s security risk in the event of a data breech for stored cards because the token can be stored instead.
