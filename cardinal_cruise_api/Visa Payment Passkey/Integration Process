Before Integration

To ensure a seamless integration to Visa Payment Passkey ensure the following prerequisites are met:

    The user's device must have platform authenticators such as Face ID or Touch ID. Currently, VPP does not provide support to roaming authenticators such as YubiKey.
    The browser being used must have WebAuthN API support.
    The integrator must support the Data Exchange API.
    For browser flows, VPP is only supported for Cardinal Cruise API. For app flows, when using Web SDK, integrators would need to consider implementation of iframes in their checkout flow.

During Integration

You will need to complete the following steps:

    Check VPP Compatibility
    Check for VPP Enrollment
    Enroll a User into VPP
    Authenticate using VPP


VPP API Support

The userâ€™s browser will also need to be compatible with VPP API. The API has two core components explained in the table below:

API Name	Description	Browser Support Resourses
WebAuthN	Web Authentication API is the browser spec that enables the creation of public-key-based credentials by web applications	External Link: CanIUse: WebAuthN
isUserVerifyingPlatformAuthenticatorAvailable	This API is used directly by FIDO and as such is a hard requirement for browser API support.	External Link: CanIUse: isUserVerifyingPlatformAuthenticatorAvailable
