SSO Credential and API Keys
Suggest Edits

Authentication with Cardinal Cruise is done through Cardinal Single Sign On (SSO) application. SSO credentials will be generated during your onboarding process. SSO values consistent of:
Field	Description
Org Unit Id	GUID to identify the merchant organization within Cardinal systems
Api Identifier	GUID used to identify the specific API Key
Api Key	A shared secret value between the merchant and Cardinal. This value should never be exposed to the public.

Api Keys

A merchant can have multiple API Keys with different levels of permissions attached to each key. This for example would allow you to have 1 API Key for your front end store and another API Key with different permissions that is only used on the backend. Both API Keys would be attached to the same origination unit within our SSO application, allowing you to see all transactions for both API Keys under a single merchant with our reporting systems.

Additionally, API Keys can be rotated if your company has policies on how long credentials can be used before they must be regenerated.
